						DESCRIPTION
					</div>
					<p>
						Actually, that's still true. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

						PURPOSE
					</div>
					<p>
						It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

						INTENDED USERS
					</div>
					<p>
						There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.
