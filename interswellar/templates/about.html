						DESCRIPTION
					</div>
					<p>
						The Interswellar database is designed to beautifully present details about the wonders of space while simplifying your search for related objects. Start with a constellation and learn about the group of stars that form its recognizable pattern. Travel faster than any star ship and explore the exoplanets that orbit those stars. After you're done visiting those planets, come back to Earth and learn about the scientists who discovered them. At Interswellar, you can have your very own space adventure and make it back in time before dinner!

						PURPOSE
					</div>
					<p>
                        Planets and stars are big, but the space that they float in is even bigger. We wanted to create a database that would put together documented information about all that stuff in space and then make it interconnected for even easier navigation. We hope that this product would be as useful to the public as it was to us. It was a pleasure and an experience and we would like to share it with you!

						INTENDED USERS
					</div>
					<p>
                        Interswellar may seem like a database meant for astronomers and scientists, but we know that there's a little curious astronaut in everyone who wants to more know about the things outside our known world. No matter who we are or what we study, we share the sky and our knowledge of it. This database is an open library for all users who seek to learn about the bright jewels of our sky.
